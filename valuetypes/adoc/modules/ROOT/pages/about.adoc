In addition, the core framework has built-in support for most of the value types defined by JDK (`String`, primitives, wrapper types, date/time), and also defines a number of more specialized value types that are not part of core framework.

This section provides details of those additional value types.

[TIP]
====
Full details of all value types are in the xref:refguide:applib-classes:value-types.adoc[reference guide].

It is also possible to define custom value types; details of that in xref:userguide:ROOT:value-types.adoc[the user guide].
