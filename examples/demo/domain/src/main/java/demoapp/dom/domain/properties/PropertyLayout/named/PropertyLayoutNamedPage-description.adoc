The name of a property or parameter is used as the label of the field in the UI.
Normally the name is inferred from the name of the corresponding field or parameter in code.
This inferred name can be however be overridden using various mechanisms with an explicit value:

* for properties, the name can be specified using the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/PropertyLayout.html#named[@PropertyLayout#named] attribute, or using the link:https://causeway.apache.org/userguide/2.0.0-RC1/fun/ui.html#by-example[.layout.xml] layout file.

* for parameters, the attribute can be specified using the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/PropertyLayout.html#named[@ParameterLayout#named] annotation.

This is useful for example if the desired name is a Java keyword (such as "default", or "package").


== How this demo works

=== Annotated

The name can be specified explicitly using an annotation:

* for properties, using `@PropertyLayout#named()`:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyLayoutNamedPage.java[tags=annotation]
----
<.> explicitly specifies the name of the property

* for parameters, using `@ParameterLayout#named()`:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyLayoutNamedPage_updateWithParameterLayout.java[tags=annotation]
----
<.> explicitly specifies the name of the parameter

=== Layout File

The name can be specified using the `Xxx.layout.xml` file:

WARNING: currently this does not work; link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAUSEWAY-3443[CAUSEWAY-3443].

* property definition:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyLayoutNamedPage.java[tags=layout-file]
----
<.> `named` hint is _not_ present.

* layout file snippet:
+
[source,xml,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
<cpt:property id="propertyUsingLayout">
    <cpt:named>Named using layout.xml</cpt:named>
</cpt:property>
----
// TODO: for some reason this doesn't include correctly in the app...
//include::PropertyLayoutNamedPage.layout.xml[tags=layout-file]

One advantage of the layout file over the annotation is that the layout file is dynamic: it can be modified and the changes reloaded in a running application.
