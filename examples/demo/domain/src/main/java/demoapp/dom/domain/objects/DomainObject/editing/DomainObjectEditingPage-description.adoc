The state of the application can be changed either by invoking actions on domain objects, or by directly editing their properties.

If the application has complicated business logic, then it's usually preferable to make all changes using actions, with editing globally disabled using a configuration property:

[source,yaml]
.application.yml
----
causeway:
  applib:
    annotation:
      domain-object:
        editing: false    # false | true
----

This demo application is configured in this recommended way, with property editing disabled by default.

The link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObject.html#editing[@DomainObject#editing] annotation can be used to override the default for a specific object, so that all of its properties can be edited.
It's also possible to override the class-level default on a per-property basis, using the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/Property.html#editing[@Property#editing] attribute.

There are therefore three levels at which property editing can be defined:

    @Property > @DomainObject > global configuration property

Alternatively, this works in the opposite direction also: if the global config property is to _allow_ properties to be edited, then the `@DomainObject#editing` can be used to disable editing and `@Property#editing`.

In addition, the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObject.html#editingDisabledReason[@DomainObject#editingDisabledReason] can be used to specify the reason why a property cannot be edited.
This can also be specified at the property level using link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/Property.html#editingDisabledReason[@Property#editingDisabledReason].

== How this demo works

The collection on the left shows a set of entity instances, which use `@DomainObject#editing` to enable editing of their properties.
However, `@Property#editing` is then used to disable the "originalName" property.
The "initialCharacter" property cannot be edited either, because it is a derived property (has only a getter).

Navigate through to the entity in order to edit its properties, and to see the corresponding source code.
