The framework includes _experimental_ support for embedded types.
These are somewhat similar to value types, in that they have no identity and are persisted inline within their owning object.
They can also have custom behaviour.

However, they are not quite true value types as the ORM needs to update their fields directly.
To enable that, a mutator method is required, though it can be made `private`

CAUTION: This is still work in progress, see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAUSEWAY-1695[CAUSEWAY-1695].

== How this demo works

This page object has a collection `allConstants` that just returns a set of `NumberConstantJpa` entities.
The `NumberConstantJpa` entity defines a `name` property (of type `String) and a `numberConstant` property (of type `ComplexNumberJpa`).
It is this second property that we are interested in:

[source,java]
.NumberConstantJpa.java
----
include::NumberConstantJpa.java[tags=class]
----
<.> JPA `@Embedded` annotation indicates that the constituent parts of the embedded type should be stored as columns of the owning entity


== Embedded type

The `ComplexNumberJpa` type must also be annotated as embedded.
We also annotate it with `@Value`; this instructs the framework how to interact with the type:

[source,java]
.ComplexNumberJdo.java
----
include::ComplexNumberJpa.java[tags=class]
----
<.> Indicates to the ORM that this _is_ persisted data ...
<.> \... but can only be embedded.
<.> Indicates how the framework interacts with properties and parameters of this type.
This is explained further in the "value semantics provider" section below.
<.> All fields are accessible ...
<.> \... but can only be mutated by the ORM (so acts like a value type).

This class defines some behaviour:

* its title:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ComplexNumberJpa.java[tags=title]
----

* how to parse a string:
+
[source,java]
----
include::ComplexNumberJpa.java[tags=parse,indent=0]
----
+
This is used by the "value semantics provider", discussed in the next section.

As well as using this type as a property, it can also be used as a parameter.
The `NumberConstantJdo_updateNumber` mixin allows the value of the complex number held by any `NumberConstant` to be updated footnote:[somewhat dubious code, but this is only an example!]:

[source,java]
.NumberConstantJdo_updateNumber.java
----
include::NumberConstantJpa_updateNumber.java[tags=class]
----


== Value Semantics Provider

As mentioned in the previous section, the framework uses an implementation of `ValueSemanticsProvider` to know how to interact with properties and parameters of the type:

[source,java]
.ComplexNumberJdoValueSemantics.java
----
include::ComplexNumberJpaValueSemantics.java[tags=class]
----

where:

* `getRenderer()` is responsible for rendering the value:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ComplexNumberJpaValueSemantics.java[tags=getRenderer]
----

* `getParser()` is responsible for parsing the entered string (for either an editable property or a parameter):
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ComplexNumberJpaValueSemantics.java[tags=getParser]
----
+
In this case the implementation just delegates to the `ComplexNumberJdo` class itself.

* `getEncoderDecoder()` converts the value into a string for marshalling and other purposes:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ComplexNumberJpaValueSemantics.java[tags=getEncoderDecoder]
----

* `getDefaultsProvider()` returns the default value to be used for non-optional parameters and properties:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ComplexNumberJpaValueSemantics.java[tags=getDefaultsProvider]
----
