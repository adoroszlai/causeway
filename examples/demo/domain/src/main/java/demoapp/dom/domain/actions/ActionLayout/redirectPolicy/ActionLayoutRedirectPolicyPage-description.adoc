If an action returns its target, then the `redirectPolicy` attribute determines
whether to update the page or instead to redirect (forcing a re-rendering of a new page).

Not re-rendering can provide a smoother UI experience.

[WARNING]
====
This feature is currently *not* supported by the _Wicket Viewer_ https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAUSEWAY-1659

(Perhaps a feasible showcase could be to render a local time property, then demonstrate that its UI would not update after action invocation.)

<.> this action returns its target, and so setting `ONLY_IF_DIFFERS` instructs the _viewer_ to not re-render the current page
