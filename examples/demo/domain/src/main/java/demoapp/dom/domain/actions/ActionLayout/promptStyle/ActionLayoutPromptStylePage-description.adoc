Most actions take parameters, and so the framework renders a prompt to allow the parameter arguments to be specified.
The link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/applib/index/annotation/ActionLayout.html#promptstyle[@ActionLayout#promptStyle] attribute allows the position of this prompt to be specified.

== How this demo works

This page has two properties, `name` and `notes`.
The `name` property has three associated (mixin) actions, each of which can be used to update it, but demonstrating three of the prompt styles:


* `promptStyle` of _inline_:
+
[source,java]
----
include::ActionLayoutPromptStylePage_updateNamePromptInline.java[tags=class]
----

* `promptStyle` of _sidebar_:
+
[source,java]
----
include::ActionLayoutPromptStylePage_updateNamePromptSidebar.java[tags=class]
----

* `promptStyle` of _modal_:
+
[source,java]
----
include::ActionLayoutPromptStylePage_updateNamePromptModal.java[tags=class]
----

The `notes` property meanwhile demonstrates the use of the final "inline-as-if-edit" prompt style:

* `promptStyle` of _inline-as-if-edit_:
+
[source,java]
----
include::ActionLayoutPromptStylePage_updateNotesPromptInlineAsIfEdit.java[tags=class]
----
+
This means that for the end-user it seems that they are just editing the property directly, but in the code the action is invoked.


== Related configuration property

The Wicket viewer allows the default prompt style to be specified using a global configuration property:

[source,yaml]
.application.yml
----
causeway:
  viewer:
    wicket:
      dialog-mode: sidebar  # sidebar | modal
----

Incidentally, there is also a similar configuration property for actions invoked from  menu items:

[source,yaml]
.application.yml
----
causeway:
  viewer:
    wicket:
      dialog-mode-for-menu: sidebar  # sidebar | modal
----

NOTE: For both of these configuration properties, note that the two other variants (`inline` and `inline-as-if-edit`) are not available.

== .layout.xml

Instead of using `@ActionLayout#promptStyle`, it is also possible to specify a name in the link:https://causeway.apache.org/userguide/2.0.0-RC1/fun/ui.html#by-example[.layout.xml] file:

[source,xml]
.Xxx.layout.xml
----
...
<action id="updateName" promptStyle="MODAL"/>
...
----

The main advantage of using the `.layout.xml` file is that changes can be picked up without having to restart the application.
