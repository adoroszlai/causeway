If the `entityChangePublishing` element has been specified using a custom meta-annotation, for example as disabled, it can still be overridden on a per-class basis.

This would be useful if you used a common meta-annotation for a bunch of semantics, but wanted to override just this `entityChangePublishing` semantic for a particular class.

* So, with a meta-annotation is defined as:
+
[source,java]
----
include::../../DomainObjectEntityChangePublishingDisabledMetaAnnotation.java[tags=class]
----
<.> disables the `entityChangePublishing` for all domain object that it is applied to
<.> annotation can be applied to the type or a further meta-annotation type only

* it can be overridden at the domain class:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::DomainObjectEntityChangePublishingEnabledMetaAnnotOverriddenJpa.java[tags=class]
----
<.> the `entityChangePublishing` semantic is inherited from the meta-annotation, however...
<.> it is overridden at the domain class level
