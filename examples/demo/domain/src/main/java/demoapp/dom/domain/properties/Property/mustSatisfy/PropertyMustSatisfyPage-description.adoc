The link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/applib/index/annotation/Property.html#mustsatisfy[@Property#mustSatisfy] attribute specifies an arbitrary constraint that the value entered into the property must satisfy:

* for properties, the attribute can be specified using the `@Property` annotation

* for parameters, the attribute can be specified using the `@Parameter` annotation

The constraint is provided as a concrete class that implements the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/spec/Specification.html[Specification].
This is usually done by subclassing link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/spec/AbstractSpecification.html[AbstractSpecification].
(There are also i18n versions of these classes, link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/spec/Specification2.html[Specification2] and link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/spec/AbstractSpecification2.html[AbstractSpecification2]).

TIP: See the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib-classes/spec.html[reference guide] for more background on the specification pattern.

== How this demo works

This page has a single `customerAge` property, which is of type `Integer`.
This can be edited directly, or can also be updated using an action.

We also have a rule that a customer must be aged between 18 and 65.
This is expressed using a `Specification`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::OfWorkingAgeSpecification.java[tags=class]
----

To enforce this rule, we use the `mustSatisfy` attribute.

* to edit the property directly:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.PropertyMustSatisfyPage.java
----
include::PropertyMustSatisfyPage.java[tags=annotation]
----
<.> explicitly specifies that the property holds an integer in the range 18 to 65


* To update using an action:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.PropertyMustSatisfyPage_updateCustomerAge.java
----
include::PropertyMustSatisfyPage_updateCustomerAge.java[tags=annotation]
----
<.> explicitly specifies that the parameter holds an integer in the range 18 to 65
