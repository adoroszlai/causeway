Moving the mouse over to the top-left of the page will bring down a set of bookmarks.
If an object is rendered and the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObjectLayout.html#bookmarking[@DomainObjectLayout#bookmarking] is set appropriately, then a link to it will be added automatically to the bookmark list, so that the end-user can easily navigate back to the page later on in their session.

To make this set of bookmarks more useful, the set of bookmarks can be organised into a tree.
An object annotated as a link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/BookmarkPolicy.html#as_root[root] bookmark will always be added.
However an object annotated as a link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/BookmarkPolicy.html#as_child[child] bookmark will only be added if its parent object is also bookmarked.

== How this demo works

On the left hand side is a collection of objects.
These are all annotated as root bookmarks.
Navigate into any of them and a bookmark should be added to the bookmark list.

In addition, these "parent" objects have an action "addChildren".
Call this action and a set of objects will be added.
These children objects are annotated to use "child" bookmarks.
Navigate into any child object and their bookmark should be added at the correct place.
