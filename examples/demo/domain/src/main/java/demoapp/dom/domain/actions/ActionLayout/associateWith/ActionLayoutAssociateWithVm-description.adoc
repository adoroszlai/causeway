The `associateWith` attribute associates an action with a property or collection, specifying its id.

[source,java,indent=0]

include::ActionLayoutAssociateWithVm.java[tags=act_and_prop]
----

<.> associates this action `'act'` with property `'property'`

To specify the layout order use `ActionLayout#sequence()`.

.for example
----
@ActionLayout(associateWith="items") @ActionLayout(sequence="2.1")
----

Note that it is also possible to associate an action with a collection using `Action#choicesFrom`, 
which has the additional semantic of the rows of the element being used as choices for that actionâ€™s collection parameter 
of the same type as the elements of the collection.
