The `associateWith` attribute ...

WARNING: TODO[CAUSEWAY-3310]
Associates this action with a property or collection, specifying its id.
To specify the layout order use ActionLayout#sequence() .
For example @ActionLayout(associateWith="items") @ActionLayout(sequence="2.1")
Note that it is also possible to associate an action with a collection using Action#choicesFrom() (which has the additional semantic of the rows of the element being used as choices for that actionâ€™s collection parameter of the same type as the elements of the collection).
