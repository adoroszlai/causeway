When a collection of entities are rendered by the viewer, the table will by default have one column for every property that is not otherwise universally hidden (eg using `@Property(hidden = Where.ALL_TABLES`).

Sometimes though the columns to be shown will depend upon the context in which the entity is being interacted.
One common approach is to define a view model as a projection of the entity, and return a collection of that view model instead.
However, if the user wants to access the entity they must first navigate to the view model, and from their navigate to the backing entity instance that it wraps.

The purpose of the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/applib/index/annotation/Property.html#projecting[@Property#projecting] attribute is to eliminate this extra hop.

The idea is that the `projecting` attribute is placed on the property of the view model that references the backing entity.
With this hint, the viewer instead renders links to the entity rather than the view model.
From the end-user's perspectice, they aren't aware that a view model is in use at all.

== How this demo works

The diagram below shows how the domain objects of the demo app are related:

// see diag.adoc

image::/demoapp/dom/annotDomain/Property/projecting/uml-class-diag.png[]

The property from `PropertyPublishingChildVm` to `PropertyPublishingChildJdo` is annotated as a projecting property:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::child/PropertyProjectingChildVm.java[tags=projecting]
----
<.> projecting property
<.> it is _not_ necessary for the property to be visible

The "parent" `PropertyPublishingVm` has both:

* a collection of child view model objects:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyProjectingPage.java[tags=children]
----

* a property referencing a single child view model:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyProjectingPage.java[tags=property]
----

In both cases, following the link to the view model instead navigates to the backing entity.

[TIP]
====
As it isn't possible to access the projection view model at all, there's little need to define a `layout.xml` file.
