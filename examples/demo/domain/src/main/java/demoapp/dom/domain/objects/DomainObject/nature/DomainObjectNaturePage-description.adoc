Domain classes fall into three broad categories:

* (singleton) domain services representing menus, eg whose actions are rendered in the menubars.
* domain entities, representing shared persistence state (eg `Customer`, `Order`, `Product` and so on)
* link:https://causeway.apache.org/userguide/${CAUSEWAY_VERSION}/fun/overview.html#view-models[view models], which hold session-specific (temporary) state.
+
View models can be used for a variety of use cases, such as a "manager" class to handle a complicated workflow (part of an "application layer"), or as an object to render as a simplified representation of an entity (part of the "presentation layer").

The object you are looking at right now is a view model; its source code is:

[source,java]
.DomainObjectNaturePage.java
----
include::DomainObjectNaturePage.java[tags=class]
----

<.> Specifies this is a JAXB element.
This is actually enough for the framework to infer that this domain object is a view model.
<.> Nevertheless, it's generally good practice to specifuy the nature explicitly.

In many cases the framework is able to infer the nature of the domain object from annotations such as `@Entity` or `@PersistenceCapable` (for JPA or JDO entities), or from `@XmlElement` for JAXB-style view models.
The purpose of link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/applib/index/annotation/DomainObject.html#nature[@DomainObject#nature] is to make the nature explicit.

[TIP]
.Long URLs
====
As you might have noticed, view models are often represented by long URLs.
This is because their state is encoded into that URL.

If the URL is too long, or if it holds sensitive data that needs to be encrypted, then the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/${CAUSEWAY_VERSION}/applib-svc/UrlEncodingService.html[UrlEncodingService] SPI allows different serializations to be provided.

=== How this demo works

There are two collections on the left hand side, one of domain entities and the other of view models.
The entities are obtained by querying a repository, while the view models are created on the fly, each wrapping a corresponding entity.

Navigate through to these domain objects to inspect their source code; both the entity and view model explicitly indicates its `nature`.
