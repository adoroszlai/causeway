If an action parameter is a reference type (typically an entity), then a mechanism is required to present a list of relevant existing instances for the end-user to select.

If the list of available instances is always or often the same, then this can result in a lot of boilerplate.
The link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObject.html#autoCompleteRepository[@DomainObject#autoCompleteRepository] attribute allows a `@Repository` service to be nominated as containing a suitable `autoComplete(String)` method returning a list of the corresponding domain class.
The link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/DomainObject.html#autoCompleteMethod[@DomainObject#autoCompleteMethod] attribute can be used if the name of this method is something other than the default of "autoComplete".

TIP: In fact, the return type of the `autoComplete` method does not need to exactly match that of the annotated domain type; it is sufficient to return any superclass or indeed an interface.

== How this demo works

The collection on the left shows a set of entity instances, of type `DomainObjectAutoComplete`.

The "find" (mixin) action defines the entity class as its parameter type, and simply returns it.

[source,java,indent=0]
.DomainObjectAutoCompletePage_find.java
----
include::DomainObjectAutoCompletePage_find.java[tags=class]
----
<.> just returns the provided object.
The main work is performed when the framework renders the action prompt, using the `autoCompleteXxx` attributes to determine how to obtain the objects to provide (in a drop-down list box).

The autoComplete search to perform is specified using the `autoCompleteRepository` and `autoCompleteMethod` attributes.

Navigate through to the entity to see the corresponding source code.
