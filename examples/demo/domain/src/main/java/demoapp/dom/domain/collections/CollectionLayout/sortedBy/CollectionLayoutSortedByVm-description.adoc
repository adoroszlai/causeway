The `sortedBy` attribute ...

WARNING: TODO[CAUSEWAY-3311]
Indicates that the elements in a ( java.util.SortedSet ) collection should be sorted according to a different order than the natural sort order, as defined by the specified java.util.Comparator .
Whenever there is a collection of type java.util.SortedSet , the domain entity referenced is expected to implement Comparable , ie to have a natural ordering. In effect tis means that all domain entities should provide a natural ordering.
However, in some circumstances the ordering of collection may be different to the entityâ€™s natural ordering. For example, the entity may represent an interval of time sorted by its startDate ascending, but the collection may wish to sort by startDate .
The purpose of this annotation is to provide a java.util.Comparator such that the collection may be sorted in an order more suitable to the context.
