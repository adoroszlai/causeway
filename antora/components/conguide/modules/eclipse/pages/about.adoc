== Code Style / Initial IDE Configuration

Additional configuration of Eclipse for contributors (and committers):

* Set up the link:{attachmentsdir}/Apache-Causeway.importorder[import order]

Also:

* set up link:{attachmentsdir}/Apache-code-style-formatting.xml[code formatting]
* set up the link:{attachmentsdir}/Apache-code-style-template.xml[code style templates]
* set up link:{attachmentsdir}/Apache-Causeway-code-style-cleanup.xml[code style cleanup]

== Prepare for Build

The project/artifact `causeway-core-privileged` is required to be an _automatic module_ in the _Java Platform Module System_ (JPMS) sense.
(In other words, it has unrestricted access to the class-path but not the module-path.)

However, at the time of writing, _Eclipse_ does *not* support automatic module name resolution for projects that are also *opened* in the IDE.
Instead it will resolve such module names only from *closed* projects, that previously had been built and installed via _Maven_ to the local repository (typically `~/.m2/repository`).

What this means in practice is that you should:

* build the framework once outside of the IDE, using Maven
* in the IDE, open the project from the top-level `pom.xml`
* immediately close the `causeway-core-privileged` module (to force the IDE to resolve from the local repository, as described above).

Although not mandatory, you might also find it worth closing the `causeway-schema` module.
That's because this module uses a Maven plugin to generate code from XSDs, and sometimes the IDE might overwrite/remove these generated files.
