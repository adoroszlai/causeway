== Simpleapp Maintenance (JDO and JPA)

When making updates for simpleapp, use the following process:

=== If the change applies to the currently released version:

. make change to jpa, then merge down to jpa-SNAPSHOT
. also merge jpa -> jdo, and fix any persistence differences if nec.
. then merge jpa -> jpa-SNAPSHOT
. finally, merge jpa-SNAPSHOT -> jdo-SNAPSHOT (should be a no-op)

Doing it this way makes it easy to keep the branches in sync.

=== If the change applies to the current snapshot, then simply:

. make change to jpa-SNAPSHOT
. merge jpa-SNAPSHOT to jdo-SNAPSHOT, and fix any persistence differences

[NOTE]
====
If you do want to update the antora docs and have them updated on-line, then the procedure is to check out the currently released branch and make changes there.
Then we build and copy over to the `apache/causeway-site` repo to publish up to https://causeway.apache.org.
