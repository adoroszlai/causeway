To page describes how to update the website _between_ releases.

As part of the release process we xref:post-release-successful.adoc#generate-website[generate] and publish the website.
<<<<<<< HEAD
An (intentional) side-effect of this process is to create a branch for the release (that is, `{page-causewayrelv3}`).
This branch can then be used for documentation updates.
=======
An (intentional) side-effect of this process is to create a branch for the release (that is, `{page-causewayprevv2}` or `{page-causewayprevv3}).
>>>>>>> refs/remotes/origin/master

If we need to make a change:

* make the change on `master` as normal (so that the docs will be there for the next release)
* cherry-pick the changes onto these documentation branches.

Then publish as per the main release process:

<<<<<<< HEAD
In the regular `causeway` repo:

* Check out the branch:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git checkout {page-causewayrelv3}
----

* make documentation updates, and commit changes

* make sure the tooling is built:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
#TODO this is outdated info
mvn -D module-tooling -D skip.essential install -DskipTests
----

* generate the website:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
sh preview.sh
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This now runs updates the config properties automatically (unless suppressed by a flag)

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn clean install -pl core/config
----
====

This updated website is written to `antora/target/site`; we'll use the results in the xref:#publish-website[next section].
=======
* xref:comguide:ROOT:post-release-successful.adoc#generate-the-site[generate the site]
* xref:comguide:ROOT:post-release-successful.adoc#publish-website[publish the site].
* xref:comguide:ROOT:post-release-successful.adoc#update-the-algolia-search-index[update the algolia search index]
