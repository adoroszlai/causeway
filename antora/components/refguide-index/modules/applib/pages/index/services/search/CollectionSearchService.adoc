If a xref:refguide:applib:index/services/search/CollectionSearchService.adoc[CollectionSearchService] is registered with Spring's context, viewer implementations (like Wicket Viewer) should show a quick-search prompt, which is rendered on top of the UI table that presents the collection in question.

[#searchFilter_Class_String]
=== searchFilter(Class, String)

Optionally returns a _Predicate_ that filters collections of given _domainType_ by a nullable _searchString_ , based on whether the search is supported.

For example, the searchString could be parsed into tokens, and then matched against the domain object's title say.
