EXPERIMENTAL/DRAFT

If a xref:refguide:applib:index/services/filter/CollectionFilterService.adoc[CollectionFilterService] is registered with Spring's context, viewer implementations (like Wicket Viewer) should show a quick-search prompt, which is rendered on top of the UI table that presents the collection in question.

[#searchFilter_Class_String]
=== searchFilter(Class, String)

Optionally returns a _Predicate_ that filters collections of given _domainType_ by a nullable _searchString_ , based on whether the search is supported.

For example, the searchString could be tokenized (parsed into tokens), and then matched against the _Tokens_ using either OR or AND semantics.

The default implementation sanitizes the user input (searchArg) then strips any leading or trailing blanks and handles the empty searchArg case.

[#sanitzeSearchArgument_String]
=== sanitzeSearchArgument(String)

Pre-process user input before passing it to the matcher.

Default behavior is to strip leading or trailing blanks (if any).
