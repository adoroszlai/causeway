== AuditTrailEntryRepository and others have simplified the API (CAUSEWAY-3390)

In this release the `AuditTrailEntryRepository` and similar is no longer parameterized by the entity type, and is also an interface.

So, instead of:

[source,java]
----
@Inject AuditTrailEntryRepository<? extends AuditTrailEntry> auditTrailEntryRepository;
----

it should now be just:

[source,java]
----
@Inject AuditTrailEntryRepository auditTrailEntryRepository;
----

This applies to:

* xref:refguide:extensions:index/audittrail/applib/dom/AuditTrailEntryRepository.adoc[]
* xref:refguide:extensions:index/commandlog/applib/dom/CommandLogEntryRepository.adoc[]
* xref:refguide:extensions:index/executionlog/applib/dom/ExecutionLogEntryRepository.adoc[]
* xref:refguide:extensions:index/executionoutbox/applib/dom/ExecutionOutboxEntryRepository.adoc[]
* xref:refguide:extensions:index/sessionlog/applib/dom/SessionLogEntryRepository.adoc[]

For more details, see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAUSEWAY-3390[CAUSEWAY-3390].


== Auto-flush management (CAUSEWAY-3675)

By default any queries executed by xref:refguide:applib:index/services/repository/RepositoryService.adoc[] are preceded by a flush first.
The rationale behind this is to make sure that everything that might have changed is in the database.

However, with JDO at least, this behaviour can cause a `ConcurrentModificationException` when coupled with the  xref:refguide:persistence:index/commons/integration/changetracking/EntityChangeTrackerDefault.adoc[] internal service, used by auditing.
This grabs the value of properties, including derived properties that are evaluated using a query.

So now, xref:refguide:persistence:index/commons/integration/changetracking/EntityChangeTrackerDefault.adoc[] suppresses the autoflush.

Changes:

* To revert to the original behaviour, use the new `causeway.commons.persistence.entity-change-tracker.suppress-auto-flush` property.

* The `causeway.core.runtime-services.repository=service.disable-auto-flush` configuration property has been renamed to `causeway.commons.persistence.repository-service.disable-auto-flush`.
