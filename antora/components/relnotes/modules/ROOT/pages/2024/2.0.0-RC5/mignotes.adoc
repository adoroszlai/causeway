== AuditTrailEntryRepository and others have simplified the API.



In this release the `AuditTrailEntryRepository` and similar is no longer parameterized by the entity type, and is also an interface.

So, instead of:

[source,java]
----
@Inject AuditTrailEntryRepository<? extends AuditTrailEntry> auditTrailEntryRepository;
----

it should now be just:

[source,java]
----
@Inject AuditTrailEntryRepository auditTrailEntryRepository;
----

This applies to:

* xref:refguide:extensions:index/audittrail/applib/dom/AuditTrailEntryRepository.adoc[]
* xref:refguide:extensions:index/commandlog/applib/dom/CommandLogEntryRepository.adoc[]
* xref:refguide:extensions:index/executionlog/applib/dom/ExecutionLogEntryRepository.adoc[]
* xref:refguide:extensions:index/executionoutbox/applib/dom/ExecutionOutboxEntryRepository.adoc[]
* xref:refguide:extensions:index/sessionlog/applib/dom/SessionLogEntryRepository.adoc[]
