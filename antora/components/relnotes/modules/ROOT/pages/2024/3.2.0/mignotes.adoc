== Renaming of Term 'scalar' -> 'attribute'

Since the initial design of the framework, UI components exist to represent a single `property` or `parameter` 
such as domain-object references or values (textual, temporal, numerical etc.).  

The term to refer to both (action) parameters and (domain object) properties collectively was `scalar`. 
Unfortunately this is a misnomer, because parameters are also allowed to be multi-valued, 
hence the term `scalar` is potentially misleading.  

Searching for a better fitting term we came up with `attribute`, 
as we are referring to both method parameters and instance fields collectively as *attributes* of a _class_ or _method_. 
(While not on point, at least `attribute` is not misleading regarding cardinality.)

Hence many UI and model classes needed to be renamed accordingly.
