As well as scalar values, action parameters can also be collections.
For this to be valid, a _choices_ or _autoComplete_ supporting method must be provided.

For example, suppose we want to "tag" or "label" an object:

[source,java]
----
public StoryCard tag(List<Tag> tags) {
    getTags().addAll(tags);
}

public List<Tag> autoCompleteTag(@MinLength(1) search) {
    return tagRepository.findByName(search);
}
----


If the action has been associated with a collection, using xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Action.adoc#choicesFrom[@Action#choicesFrom()], then the collection can be used to provide a list of candidate values.

The xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Web UI (Wicket viewer)] handles this by rendering checkboxes against the associated collection; the user can select/deselect these checkboxes and the selected items are taken as the values for the multi-select action.
