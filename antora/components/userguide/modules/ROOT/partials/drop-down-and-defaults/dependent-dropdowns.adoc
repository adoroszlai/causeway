For action it is also possible (in a limited form) to define dependencies between parameters.
Specifically, if one parameter is a drop-down choice, then other drop-down choices can be derived from it.

A good example is a category/sub-category:

[source,java]
----
public ToDoItem categorize(
            Category category,
            Subcategory subcategory) {
    setCategory(category);
    setSubcategory(subcategory);
}

public List<Category> choices0Categorize() {
    return categoryRepository.allCategories();
}
public List<Subcategory> choices1Categorize(        // <.>
                                Category category) {
    return subcategoryRepository.findBy(category);
}
----
<.> Returns a list of choices for the 2nd parameter based on the argument provided for the first.
