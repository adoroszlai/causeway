// TODO: clean up

It is this argument's parameter type which determines the domain class being contributed to.

[source,java]
----
@Action                                     // <.>
@RequiredArgsConstructor                    // <.>
public class Customer_placeOrder {          // <.>

    private final Customer customer;        // <.>

    // ...                                  // <.>
}

<.> Determines this is a mixin that will contribute an action
<.> It's common to use lombok to generate the constructor (for the one `final` field)
<.> The name is derived from the class name; anything after the '_'.
The name beforehand can be anything, but the convention is to use the mixee's name
<.> A field declaring the mixee.
The action implementation itself will interact with the mixee .
<.> Actual implementation not yet shown, keep reading :-)

== Contributing through an interface

The contribution could be through a Java interface.
Suppose that `Customer` implements `DocumentHolder`:

[source,java]
----
@Collection
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class DocumentHolder_documents {

    private final DocumentHolder documentHolder;

    // ...
}
----

In both cases, when the `Customer` is rendered in the user interface, it will appear to have a "placeOrder" action or a "documents" collection.
Programmatically, the `Customer` itself won't know anything about this behaviour.
Indeed, if the mixin is defined in some other (Maven) module (such as "ordermgmt" say), then the `Customer` class won't even be able to access this contributed behaviour.
