If you have defined an action as a mixin, then the name of the method is "act" and so supporting methods (which match on the name) are easier to write.
For example, the supporting method to hide the action will always be called "hideAct".

In the regular programming model, the supporting methods for individual parameters are matched by number, eg "validate0Act" to validate the 0-th argument.
If using mixins, there are two alternative syntaxes for implementing the supporting methods for actions that you may prefer.
This page describes them both.
