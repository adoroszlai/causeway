Apache Causeway supports recognises five main types of domain classes:

* *domain entities* - domain objects persisted to the database the ORM (eg  JDO/DataNucleus); for example `Customer`

* *domain services* - generally singletons, automatically injected, and providing various functionality; for example `CustomerRepository`

* *view models* - domain objects that are a projection of some state held by the database, in support a particular use case; for example `CustomerDashboard` (to pull together commonly accessed information about a customer).

* *mixins* - allow functionality to be "contributed" in the UI by one module to another object, similar to traits or extension methods provided in some programming languages.
This is an important capability to help keep large applications decoupled.

* *value types*

// TODO : flesh this section out.

From the end-user's perspective the UI displays a single domain object instance that has state (that is, a domain entity or a view model) per page.
The end-user can then inspect and modify its state, and navigate to related objects.

Domain classes are generally recognized using annotations.
Apache Causeway defines its own set of annotations, and
you can generally recognize an Apache Causeway domain class because it will be probably be annotated using xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/DomainObject.adoc[@DomainObject] and xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/DomainService.adoc[@DomainService].

The framework also recognises some annotations from the ORM layer (ie JPA/EclipseLink or JDO/DataNucleus) and infers domain semantics from these annotations.
Similarly, JAXB annotations are typically used for view models.

The framework also defines supplementary annotations, notably xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/DomainObjectLayout.adoc[@DomainObjectLayout] and xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/DomainServiceLayout.adoc[@DomainServiceLayout].
These provide hints relating to the layout of the domain object in the user interface.
Alternatively, these UI hints might be defined in a supplementary xref:userguide:ROOT:ui.adoc#object-layout[.layout.xml] file.
