The two main rule of thumbs for dependencies are:

. there should be no cyclic dependencies (the module dependencies should form an acyclic graph), and
. unstable modules should depend upon stable modules, rather than the other way around.

By "unstable" we don't mean buggy, rather this relates to its likelihood to change its structure or behaviour over time: in other words its stability as a core set of concepts upon which other stuff can depend.
Reference data (calendars, tax rates, lookups etc) are generally stable, as are "golden" concept such as counterparties / legal entities or financial accounts.
Transactional concepts such as invoices or agreements is perhaps more likely to change.
But this stuff is domain specific.
