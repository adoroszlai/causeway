The GraphQL Specification (link:https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Names[]) requires that names of fields and types use only a subset of ASCII characters.
On the other hand the GraphQL viewer will infer these fields from the Java domain objects, which permits a wider range of characters.

To ensure that only permitted characters are used in the GraphQL model, use the xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Property.adoc#asciiId[@Property#asciiId], xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Collection.adoc#asciiId[@Collection#asciiId], xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Action.adoc#asciiId[@Action#asciiId] and xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Parameter.adoc#asciiId[@Parameter#asciiId].

For example:

[source,java]
.I18nCalculator
----
@Named("university.calc.I18nCalculator")
@DomainService(nature= NatureOfService.VIEW)
@Priority(PriorityPrecedence.EARLY)
@RequiredArgsConstructor(onConstructor_ = {@Inject})
public class I18nCalculator {

    @Action(semantics = SemanticsOf.SAFE, asciiId = "concat")
    public String concät(
            @Parameter(asciiId = "a1")
            String ä1,
            @Parameter(asciiId = "a2")
            String ä2) {
        return ä1 + ä2;
    }
}
