The GraphQL viewer automatically exposes an Apache Causeway domain object model as a link:https://graphql.org/[GraphQL] API.
The viewer iterates over the domain services and domain objects, with their actions, properties and collections represented as fields within the graph.
Actions that take parameters are mapped to fields with arguments.

The GraphQL viewer is implemented using link:https://spring.io/projects/spring-graphql[Spring GraphQL] project, which in turn is built on top of link:https://www.graphql-java.com/[GraphQL Java].
This also means that it automatically provides the link:https://github.com/graphql/graphiql[GraphiQL] interactive query tool.

== Concepts

=== API Variants

The GraphQL viewer supports 3 different API variants, controlled by the xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.graphql.adoc#causeway.viewer.graphql.api-variant[causeway.viewer.graphql.api-variant] configuration property:

* `QUERY_ONLY`
+
Exposes only a Query API, of properties, collections and safe (query-onl) actions.
Any actions that mutate the state of the system (in other words are idempotent or non-idempotent are excluded from the API, as is the ability to set properties.

* `QUERY_AND_MUTATIONS`
+
Exposes an API with Query for query/safe separate queries and field access, with mutating (idempotent and non-idempotent) actions and property setters instead surfaced as Mutations, as per the link:https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Language.Operations[GraphQL spec].

* `QUERY_WITH_MUTATIONS_NON_SPEC_COMPLIANT`
+
Exposes an API with both Query and Mutations, but relaxes the constraints for the Query API by also including idempotent and non-idempotent actions and property setters.
+
Note that the actions _are_ also available through as Mutations (same as with `QUERY_AND_MUTATIONS` API variant).
+
[IMPORTANT]
Be aware that the resultant API is not compliant with the rules of the
GraphQL spec; in particular, it violates link:https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Language.Operations[2.3 Operations] which states: "query – [is] a read‐only fetch";

So the API variant primarily relates to how mutating (non-safe) actions are handled.



=== Rich vs Simple Schemas

The viewer can represent the domain model as either a "rich" GraphQL schema, or a "simple" GraphQL schema; or indeed both can be supported ath the same time.

The *rich schema* represents all the behaviour and structure of the Causeway domain model:

* hidden, disabled, validate
* choices, autoComplete, defaults
* obtain ("get") the value

In other words, it exposes not only the core data/behaviour but also of the supporting methods.

The *simple schema* represents just the core data/behaviour, but does not include the supporting method facets.

With the rich schema, the application logic and business domain logic remains the concern of the server, with the calling client app responsible only for presentation logic.
In fact, the rich schemas is so rich that one could in theory implement a fully generic UI client.

With the simple schema, although the main business domain logic remains the concern of the server, the application logic moves to the client.
For example, if there is a drop-down list box, the client needs to know how to obtain the list of choices.
But the benefit of the simple schema is, well, that it is simpler; in other words more "intuitive" and less "verbose".

The xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.graphql.adoc#causeway.viewer.graphql.schema-style[causeway.viewer.graphql.schema-style] configuration property specifies which schema (or both) is supported:

* `SIMPLE_ONLY` - exposes only the "simple" schema
* `RICH_ONLY` - exposes only the "rich" schema
* `SIMPLE_AND_RICH` - exposes both the simple and rich schemas, the top-level query for each residing under either the `simple` or `rich` field respectively.
+
For the top-level mutation, the "simple" schema is used.

* `RICH_AND_SIMPLE` - also exposes both the simple and rich schemas, the top-level query for each residing under either the `simple` or `rich` field respectively.
+
For the top-level mutation, the "rich" schema is used.




== Example

How the viewer works is probably most easily explained by an example.
The diagram below shows a simple domain footnote:[in fact, this is the domain used by the GraphQL viewer's own tests].

image::test-domain.drawio.png[width=600]

GraphQL distinguishes queries and mutations, so let's look at each.

NOTE: GraphQL also defines the notion of subscriptions; the GraphQL viewer currently has no support for these.

We'll assume here that the `SIMPLE_AND_RICH` schema style is in use:

=== Queries

To list all Departments, we can submit this query using either the "rich" schema or "simple" schema:

[cols="1a,1a", options="header"]
|===

|Rich schema
|Simple schema

[source,graphql]

{
  rich {                          #<.>
    university_dept_Departments { #<.>
      findAllDepartments {        #<.>
        invoke {                  #<.>
          results {               #<.>
            name {

            staffMembers {

                name {
                  get             #<.>
                }
                _meta {
                  id              #<.>
                  logicalTypeName #<9>
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

----
|===
<.> specify schema style
<.> domain service
<.> action name
<.> invokes the action
<.> returning a list of ``Department``s
<.> gets (accesses) the `name` property of each returned `Department`
<.> also gets (accesses) the `staffMembers` collection of each returned `Department`, returning a list of ``StaffMember``s
<.> gets the `name` prperty for each returned `StaffMember`
<.> returns the internal id and logicalTypeName of each `StaffMember`.
Together, these make up the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/bookmark/Bookmark.adoc[] of the domain object.



But if using the "rich" schema, then as well as accessing properties and collections and invoking (safe) actions, the GraphQL viewer also allows access to the usual supporting semantics.
For example:

[cols="1a,1a", options="header"]
|===

|Rich schema
|Simple schema

|
[source,graphql]
----
{
  rich {
    university_dept_Departments {
      findAllDepartments {
        disabled          #<.>
        invoke {
          results {
            name {
              hidden        #<.>
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----
|
Not supported by simple schema.
|===

<.> whether this action is disabled
<.> whether the property of the resultant object is hidden


Similarly, there are fields for action parameters:

* `validate` - is the proposed action parameter valid?
* `disable` - is the action or action parameter disabled?
* `choices` - for an action parameter, are their choices?
* `autoComplete` - for an action parameter, is there an auto-complete?
* `default` - for an action parameter, is there a default value?

There are also similar fields for properties:

* `validate` - is the proposed value of the property valid?
* `disable` - is the property disabled?
* `choices` - for a property, are their choices?
* `autoComplete` - for a property , is there an auto-complete?



The next section explains how use mutations to change the state of the system.

=== Mutations

Actions that mutate the state of the system (with idempotent or non-idempotent xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Action.adoc#semantics[@Action#semantics]) are exposed as mutations.
Editable properties are also exposed as mutations.

IF the action is on a domain service, then the target is implicit; but if the action is on a domain object -- and also for properties -- then the target domain object must be specified.

For example, to invoke a mutating action on a domain service:

[cols="1a,1a", options="header"]
|===

|Rich schema
|Simple schema

|
[source,graphql]
----
mutation {
  university_dept_Departments__createDepartment(  #<.>
      name: "Geophysics",
      deptHead: null
  ) {
    name {
      get
    }
  }
}
----

|
[source,graphql]
----
mutation {
  university_dept_Departments__createDepartment(
      name: "Geophysics",
      deptHead: null
  ) {
    name
  }
}
----

|===
<.> derived from the logical type name of the domain service, and the action Id.


For example, to invoke a mutating action on a domain object

[cols="1a,1a", options="header"]
|===

|Rich schema
|Simple schema

|
[source,graphql]
----
mutation {
  university_dept_Department__changeName(     # <.>
      _target: {id : "1"},                     # <.>
      newName: "Classics and Ancient History"
  ) {
    name {
      get
    }
  }
}
----

|
[source,graphql]
----
mutation {
  university_dept_Department__changeName(
      _target: {id : "1"},
      newName: "Classics and Ancient History"
  ) {
    name
  }
}
----

|===
<.> derived from the logical type name of the domain object, and the action Id.
<.> the `object` argument specifies the target object


Or, to set a property on a domain object:

[cols="1a,1a", options="header"]
|===

|Rich schema
|Simple schema

|
[source,graphql]
----
mutation {
  university_dept_StaffMember__name(  #<.>
      _target: {id: "1"},             #<.>
      name: "Jonathon Gartner"
  ) {
    name {                            #<.>
      get
    }
  }
}
----

|
[source,graphql]
----
mutation {
  university_dept_StaffMember__name(
      _target: {id: "1"},
      name: "Jonathon Gartner"
  ) {
    name
  }
}
----

|===
<.> derived from the logical type name of the domain object, and the property Id.
<.> the `_target` argument specifies the target object
<.> property setters are `void`, so as a convenience the mutator instead returns the target object.

=== Mutations using Queries

According to the link:https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Language.Operations[GraphQL specification], queries should be read-only; they must not change the state of the system.

The GraphQL viewer (optionally) relaxes this rule, allowing actions to be invoked that _do_ change the state of the system, and -- indeed -- allowing properties to be modified.
This is done through these additional fields:

* `invokeIdempotent` - to invoke an action whose action semantics are idempotent
+
As specified by xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Action.adoc#semantics[@Action#semantics].
* `invokeNonIdempotent` - to invoke an action whose action semantics are non-idempotent
* `set` - to modify a property.


For example, to invoke an action on a domain service:

[cols="1a,1a", options="header"]
|===

|Rich schema
|Simple schema

|
[source,graphql]
----
{
  rich {
    university_dept_Staff {
      createStaffMember {
        invokeNonIdempotent(
          name: "Dr. Georgina McGovern",
          department: { id: "1"}
      ) {
          results {
            name {
              get
            }
            department {
              get {
                name {
                  get
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

[source,graphql]

{
  simple {
    university_dept_Staff {
      createStaffMember (
          name: "Dr. Georgina McGovern",
          department: { id: "1"}
      ) {
        name
        department {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

Or, to find a domain object and then invoke a mutating action on it:

[cols="1a,1a", options="header"]
|===

|Rich schema
|Simple schema

|
[source,graphql]
----
{
  rich {
    university_dept_DeptHeads {
      findHeadByName {
        invoke(name: "Prof. Dicky Horwich") {
          results {
            changeName {
              invokeIdempotent(newName: "Prof. Richard Horwich") {
                results {
                  name {
                    get
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }

{
  simple {
    university_dept_DeptHeads {
      findHeadByName(name: "Prof. Dicky Horwich") {
        changeName(newName: "Prof. Richard Horwich") {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

|===

|Rich schema
|Simple schema

{
  rich {
    university_dept_Staff {

          results {
            name {
              set(name: "Gerald Johns") {
                name {
                  get
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

As well as this viewer, Apache Causeway also provides the xref:vro::about.adoc[], which performs the same function, but using REST instead of GraphQL.
