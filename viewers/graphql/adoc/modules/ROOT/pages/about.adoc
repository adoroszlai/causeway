The GraphQL viewer automatically exposes an Apache Causeway domain object model as a link:https://graphql.org/[graphql] API.
It is implemented using link:https://spring.io/projects/spring-graphql[Spring GraphQL] project, which in turn is built on top of link:https://www.graphql-java.com/[GraphQL Java].
This also means that it automatically provides the link:https://github.com/graphql/graphiql[GraphiQL] interactive query tool.

== Example

How the viewer works is probably most easily explained by an example.
The diagram below shows a simple domain footnote:[in fact, this is the domain used by the GraphQL viewer's own tests].

GraphQL distinguishes queries and mutations, so let's look at each.

NOTE: GraphQL also defines the notion of subscriptions; the GraphQL viewer currently has no support for these.

=== Queries

To list all Departments, we can submit this query:

[source,graphql]
----
{
  university_dept_Departments {
    findAllDepartments {
      invoke {                  #<.>
        name {
          get                   #<.>
        }
        staffMembers {
          get {                 #<.>
            name {
              get               #<.>
            }
            _gqlv_meta {
              id                #<.>
              logicalTypeName   #<5>
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----
<.> invokes the action, returning a list of ``Department``s
<.> gets (accesses) the `name` property of each returned `Department`
<.> also gets (accesses) the `staffMembers` collection of each returned `Department`, returning a list of ``StaffMember``s
<.> gets the `name` prperty for each returned `StaffMember`
<.> returns the internal id and logicalTypeName of each `StaffMember`.
Together, these make up the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/bookmark/Bookmark.adoc[] of the domain object.

As well as accessing properties and collections and invoking (safe) actions, the GraphQL viewer also allows access to the usual supporting semantics.
For example:

[source,graphql]
----
{
  university_dept_Departments {
    findAllDepartments {
      disabled          #<.>
      invoke {
        name {
          hidden        #<.>
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----
<.> whether this action is disabled
<.> whether the property of the resultant object is hidden

Similarly, there are fields for action parameters:

* `validate` - is the proposed action parameter valid?
* `disable` - is the action or action parameter disabled?
* `choices` - for an action parameter, are their choices?
* `autoComplete` - for an action parameter, is there an auto-complete?
* `default` - for an action parameter, is there a default value?

There are also similar fields for properties:

* `validate` - is the proposed value of the property valid?
* `disable` - is the property disabled?
* `choices` - for a property, are their choices?
* `autoComplete` - for a property , is there an auto-complete?


The next section explains how use mutations to change the state of the system.

=== Mutations

Actions that mutate the state of the system (with idempotent or non-idempotent xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Action.adoc#semantics[@Action#semantics]) are exposed as mutations.
Editable properties are also exposed as mutations.

IF the action is on a domain service, then the target is implicit; but if the action is on a domain object -- and also for properties -- then the target domain object must be specified.

For example, to invoke a mutating action on a domain service:

[source,graphql]
----
mutation {
  university_dept_Departments__createDepartment(  #<.>
      name: "Geophysics",
      deptHead: null
  ) {
    name {
      get
    }
  }
}
----
<.> derived from the logical type name of the domain service, and the action Id.

For example, to invoke a mutating action on a domain object:

[source,graphql]
----
mutation {
  university_dept_Department__changeName(     # <.>
      _gqlv_target: {id : "1"},               # <.>
      newName: "Classics and Ancient History"
  ) {
    name {
      get
    }
  }
}
----
<.> derived from the logical type name of the domain object, and the action Id.
<.> the `_gqlv_target` specifies the target object


Or, to set a property on a domain object:

[source,graphql]
----
mutation {
  university_dept_StaffMember__name(    #<.>
      _gqlv_target: {id: "1"},          #<.>
      name: "Jonathon Gartner"
  ) {
    name {                              #<.>
      get
    }
  }
}
----
<.> derived from the logical type name of the domain object, and the property Id.
<.> the `_gqlv_target` specifies the target object
<.> property setters are `void`, so as a convenience the mutator instead returns the target object.




=== Mutations using Queries

According to the link:https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Language.Operations[GraphQL specification], queries should be read-only; they must not change the state of the system.

The GraphQL viewer (optionally) relaxes this rule, allowing actions to be invoked that _do_ change the state of the system, and -- indeed -- allowing properties to be modified.
This is done through these additional fields:

* `invokeIdempotent` - to invoke an action whose action semantics are idempotent
+
As specified by xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Action.adoc#semantics[@Action#semantics].
* `invokeNonIdempotent` - to invoke an action whose action semantics are non-idempotent
* `set` - to modify a property.


For example, to invoke an action on a domain service

[source,graphql]
----
{
  university_dept_Staff {
    createStaffMember {
      invokeNonIdempotent(
        name: "Dr. Georgina McGovern",
        department: { id: "1"}
    ) {
        name {
          get
        }
        department {
          get {
            name {
              get
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

----

Or, to find a domain object and then invoke a mutating action on it:

[source,graphql]
----
{
  university_dept_DeptHeads {
    findHeadByName {
      invoke(name: "Prof. Dicky Horwich") {
        changeName {
          invokeIdempotent(newName: "Prof. Richard Horwich") {
            name {
              get
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

Or, similarly to find a domain object and then set a property afterwards:

[source,graphql]
----
{
  university_dept_Staff {
    findStaffMemberByName {
      invoke(name: "Gerry Jones") {
        name {
          set(name: "Gerald Johns") {
            name {
              get
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----


This relaxed mode is specified using a configuration property, see xref:setup-and-configuration.adoc[].

As well as this viewer, Apache Causeway also provides the xref:vro::about.adoc[], which performs the same function, but using REST instead of GraphQL.
