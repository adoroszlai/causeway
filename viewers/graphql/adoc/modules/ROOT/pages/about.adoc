The GraphQL viewer automatically exposes an Apache Causeway domain object model as a link:https://graphql.org/[graphql] API.
It is implemented using link:https://spring.io/projects/spring-graphql[Spring GraphQL] project, which in turn is built on top of link:https://www.graphql-java.com/[GraphQL Java].

As well as this viewer, Apache Causeway also provides the xref:vro::about.adoc[], which performs the same function, but using REST instead of GraphQL.
