== Update AppManifest

In your application's `AppManifest` (top-level Spring `@Configuration` used to bootstrap the app), import the

[source,java]
.AppManifest.java
----
@Configuration
@Import({
        ...
        CausewayModuleViewerGraphQlViewer.class,
        ...
})
public class AppManifest {
}
----


== Configuration Properties

The most important configuration property is:

* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.graphql.adoc#causeway.viewer.graphql.api-variant[causeway.viewer.graphql.api-variant]
+
Whether to support relaxed (but non-spec compliant) queries with mutations, or instead to expose an API that is query only.

In addition:

* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.graphql.adoc#causeway.viewer.graphql.meta-data.field-name[causeway.viewer.graphql.meta-data.field-name]
+
Defines the field name of the "meta data" structure used to expose the id, logical type name and (for entities) the version of a domain object.
+
The default value for this config property is "_gqlv_meta".

The xref:refguide:config:about.adoc[Configuration Guide] includes a xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.graphql.adoc[section] for the GraphQL viewer.
