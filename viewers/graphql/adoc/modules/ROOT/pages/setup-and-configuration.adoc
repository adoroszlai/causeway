This section describes how to include the GraphQL viewer's module and set its configuration properties.


include::docs:mavendeps:partial$setup-and-configure-mavendeps-webapp.adoc[leveloffset=+1]


== Update AppManifest

In your application's `AppManifest` (top-level Spring `@Configuration` used to bootstrap the app), import the

[source,java]
.AppManifest.java
----
@Configuration
@Import({
        ...
        CausewayModuleViewerGraphQlViewer.class,
        ...
})
public class AppManifest {
}
----


== Configuration Properties

The xref:refguide:config:about.adoc[Configuration Guide] includes a xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.graphql.adoc[section] for the GraphQL viewer.




=== SPI
=== Standard

Standard configuration properties:

* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.graphql.adoc#causeway.viewer.graphql.authentication.fallback.username[causeway.viewer.graphql.authentication.fallback.username] and xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.graphql.adoc#causeway.viewer.graphql.authentication.fallback.roles[causeway.viewer.graphql.authentication.fallback.roles]
+
Are used by the default implementation of xref:refguide:viewer:index/graphql/applib/auth/UserMementoProvider.adoc[], to provide a statically defined user as the executor of the API.

* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.graphql.adoc#causeway.viewer.graphql.meta-data.field-name[causeway.viewer.graphql.meta-data.field-name]
+
Defines the field name of the "meta data" structure used to expose the id, logical type name and (for entities) the version of a domain object.
+
The default value for this config property is "_gqlv_meta".

* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.graphql.adoc#causeway.viewer.graphql.type-mapper.local-date-format[causeway.viewer.graphql.type-mapper.local-date-format] and xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.graphql.adoc#causeway.viewer.graphql.type-mapper.zoned-date-time-format[causeway.viewer.graphql.type-mapper.zoned-date-time-format]
+
GraphQL does not have a built-in date datatype, and so dates must be represented as strings.
These configuration properties define the format of such strings.
+
The defaults are:
+
** "yyyy-MM-dd"
+
for local date
** "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z"
+
for (zoned) date time.

+
These are used by the default implementation of xref:refguide:viewer:index/graphql/applib/types/TypeMapper.adoc[].
