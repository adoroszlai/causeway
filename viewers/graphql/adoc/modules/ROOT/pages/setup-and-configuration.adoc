This section describes how to include the GraphQL viewer's module and set its configuration properties.


include::docs:mavendeps:partial$setup-and-configure-mavendeps-webapp.adoc[leveloffset=+1]


== Update AppManifest

In your application's `AppManifest` (top-level Spring `@Configuration` used to bootstrap the app), import the

[source,java]
.AppManifest.java
----
@Configuration
@Import({
        ...
        CausewayModuleViewerGraphQlViewer.class,
        ...
})
public class AppManifest {
}
----


== Configuration Properties

The configuration properties fall into a number of categories

=== API variant and Schema Style

The most important configuration properties are:

* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.graphql.adoc#causeway.viewer.graphql.api-variant[causeway.viewer.graphql.api-variant]
+
Whether to support relaxed (but non-spec compliant) queries with mutations, or instead to expose an API that is query only.

* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.graphql.adoc#causeway.viewer.graphql.schema-style[causeway.viewer.graphql.schema-style]
+
Whether to use the "simple" schema style (data only, client-driven), the "rich" schema style (includes supporting facets, server-driven) or both schema styles.

These were discussed on the xref:gqlv:ROOT:about.adoc[main page for GraphQL viewer].

=== Customizing the Schema

A number of other configuration properties can customize the schema in various ways.
Normally these can be left as their default:

* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.graphql.adoc#causeway.viewer.graphql.top-level-field-name-for-simple[causeway.viewer.graphql.top-level-field-name-for-simple]
+
If using the `SIMPLE_AND_RICH` or `RICH_AND_SIMPLE` schema styles, this configuration defines the name of the top-level field that holds the rest of the _simple_ schema.
+
Defaults to "simple".


* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.graphql.adoc#causeway.viewer.graphql.top-level-field-name-for-rich[causeway.viewer.graphql.top-level-field-name-for-rich]
+
If using the `SIMPLE_AND_RICH` or `RICH_AND_SIMPLE` schema styles, this configuration defines the name of the top-level field that holds the rest of the _rich_ schema.
+
Defaults to "rich".


* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.graphql.adoc#causeway.viewer.graphql.lookup.argument[causeway.viewer.graphql.lookup.argument]
+
If looking up a domain object,


* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.graphql.adoc#causeway.viewer.graphql.lookup.field-name-prefix[causeway.viewer.graphql.lookup.field-name-prefix]

* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.graphql.adoc#causeway.viewer.graphql.lookup.field-name-suffix[causeway.viewer.graphql.lookup.field-name-suffix]

* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.graphql.adoc#causeway.viewer.graphql.mutation.target-arg-name[causeway.viewer.graphql.mutation.target-arg-name]

* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.graphql.adoc#causeway.viewer.graphql.meta-data.field-name[causeway.viewer.graphql.meta-data.field-name]
+
Defines the field name of the "meta data" structure used to expose the id, logical type name and (for entities) the version of a domain object.
+
The default value for this config property is "_meta".

The xref:refguide:config:about.adoc[Configuration Guide] includes a xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.graphql.adoc[section] for the GraphQL viewer.
