This section describes how to include the GraphQL viewer's module and set its configuration properties.


include::docs:mavendeps:partial$setup-and-configure-mavendeps-webapp.adoc[leveloffset=+1]


== Update AppManifest

In your application's `AppManifest` (top-level Spring `@Configuration` used to bootstrap the app), import the

[source,java]
.AppManifest.java
----
@Configuration
@Import({
        ...
        CausewayModuleViewerGraphQlViewer.class,
        ...
})
public class AppManifest {
}
----


== Configuration Properties

The most important configuration property is:

* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.graphql.adoc#causeway.viewer.graphql.api-variant[causeway.viewer.graphql.api-variant]
+
Whether to support relaxed (but non-spec compliant) queries with mutations, or instead to expose an API that is query only.

In addition:

* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.graphql.adoc#causeway.viewer.graphql.meta-data.field-name[causeway.viewer.graphql.meta-data.field-name]
+
Defines the field name of the "meta data" structure used to expose the id, logical type name and (for entities) the version of a domain object.
+
The default value for this config property is "_gqlv_meta".

The xref:refguide:config:about.adoc[Configuration Guide] includes a xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.graphql.adoc[section] for the GraphQL viewer.


== SPI Services

The GraphQL viewer defines a couple of services that are intended to act as SPI hooks for more sophisticated implementations.
The viewer does provide default implementations.

=== UserMementoProvider

The purpose of the xref:refguide:viewer:index/graphql/applib/auth/UserMementoProvider.adoc[] SPI is to obtain the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/user/UserMemento.adoc[] -- in other words the identity -- of the client executing the API.

In a production app, this would be inferred by hooking into the request execution parameters; these are provided to the service.

The default (fallback) implementation simply uses a hard-coded value taken from the configuration:

* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.graphql.adoc#causeway.viewer.graphql.authentication.fallback.username[causeway.viewer.graphql.authentication.fallback.username]
+
The username of the client assumed to be making the GraphQL call.

* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.graphql.adoc#causeway.viewer.graphql.authentication.fallback.roles[causeway.viewer.graphql.authentication.fallback.roles]
+
Corresponding roles.
May or may not be used, depending upon the security configuration.
(For example, if xref:security:secman:about.adoc[] is in use, then the roles are defined by SecMan itself and this config property is ignored).



=== TypeMapper

The purpose of the xref:refguide:viewer:index/graphql/applib/types/TypeMapper.adoc[] SPI is to provide an extension point for the marshalling of datatypes.

The default implementation uses a number of configuration properties:

* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.graphql.adoc#causeway.viewer.graphql.type-mapper.local-date-format[causeway.viewer.graphql.type-mapper.local-date-format].
+
GraphQL does not have a built-in date datatype, and so must be represented as strings.
This configuration property define the format of such a string for a local date.
+
The default for local dates is "yyyy-MM-dd"

* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.graphql.adoc#causeway.viewer.graphql.type-mapper.zoned-date-time-format[causeway.viewer.graphql.type-mapper.zoned-date-time-format]
+
GraphQL does not have a built-in date/time datatype, and so must be represented as strings.
This configuration property define the format of such a string for a zoned date time.
+
The default for a zoned date time is "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z".


The default implementation does cover the most common data types, so it may not be necessary to override this implementation; but the option is there if required.
