== TreeAdapter 

provides the parent/child relationship information between pojos to derive a tree-structure. 
It is deliberately *not* modeled as a doubly linked tree, that is, 
we don't directly provide a link from a node to its parent node, as this would introduce circular references, 
which don't play well with immutable data structures or serialization.
