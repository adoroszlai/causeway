|Description

[[causeway.value-types.big-decimal.min-scale]]
causeway.value-types.big-decimal. +
min-scale

| 
| The minimum scale to use for all ``BigDecimal``s.

Is only used if the minimum scale has not been specified explicitly by some other means, typically either ``Digits#fraction()`` or an ORM semantic such as the (JPA) ``Column#scale()``.


|
[[causeway.value-types.big-decimal.use-scale-for-min-fractional-facet]]
causeway.value-types.big-decimal. +
use-scale-for-min-fractional-facet

|  true
| Indicates how to derive the min fractional facet (the minimum number of digits after the decimal point).

If this flag is set, then the ``Digits#fraction()`` annotation or ORM equivalent (the JDO ``@Column#scale`` or the JPA ``Column#scale()``) should be used for the ``MinFractionalFacet`` as well as the ``MaxFractionalFacet``.

What this means in practice is that a numeric values will be rendered to the same number of fractional digits, irrespective of whether they are whole numbers or fractional. For example, with a scale of 2, then "123.4532" will be rendered as "123.45", while "123" will be rendered as "123.00".

If this flag is NOT set, or if it is set but there is no annotation, then the ``#minScale`` config property is used as a fallback.

If there is no fallback, then it means that a big decimal such as "123.00" will be presented as just "123" (that is, the shortest possible textual representation).

[[causeway.value-types.kroki.backend-url]]
causeway.value-types.kroki. +
backend-url

| 
| If set, adds plantuml support to the AsciiDoc value type.

Eg. via docker instance like \{@literal yuzutech/kroki}.


|
[[causeway.value-types.kroki.request-timeout]]
causeway.value-types.kroki. +
request-timeout

|  5000ms
| Max time for requests to the ``#getBackendUrl()``, when waiting for a response. (default: 5 seconds)
