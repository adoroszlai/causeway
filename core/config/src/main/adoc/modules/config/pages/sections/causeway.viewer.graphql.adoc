[[causeway.viewer.graphql.api-variant]]
causeway.viewer.graphql. +
api-variant

| 
| Which variant of API to expose: ``ApiVariant#QUERY_ONLY`` (which suppresses any actions that mutate the state of the system), or alternatively as ``ApiVariant#QUERY_WITH_MUTATIONS_NON_SPEC_COMPLIANT`` (which does expose actions that mutate the system but within a query, and so is not spec-compliant), or as ``ApiVariant#QUERY_AND_MUTATIONS`` (which also exposes actions that mutate the system but as mutations, and so _is_ spec-compliant.

*NOTE:* ``ApiVariant#QUERY_AND_MUTATIONS`` is not currently implemented.
